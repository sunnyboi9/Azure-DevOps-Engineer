# DevOps-Engineer Test

This is a mini-test/project with two simple goals:

- Give insight to how you approach and deliver on a task
- Demonstrate your ability to present your solution

>Note: Many details are deliberately missing. There is no single "correct" answer.

## Objective/Tasks

This repository contains a simple HTML webpage developed by our experts in searching for templates via Google. We'd like you to publish this for us under the following conditions:

- **Clone this repo into a public repo of your choosing.**
  - Once there feel free to make any modifications desired to meet goals.
- **Use a public project in Azure DevOps to generate a pipeline.**
  - The pipeline should trigger on changes to master
  - The final webpage can be hosted in any manner you deem appropriate.

>Note: Please ensure you use a **public** project to avoid any operational costs and to ease our access during assessment.

## Output

In a followup meeting you will be asked for the following:

- URL for to the public AZDO project
  - If something other than Azure Repos was use, include that URL.
- URL for the functioning website
  - you do NOT need a vanity domain. Any simple endpoint will do

During the meeting you will be asked to explain your pipeline steps, hosting solution, and other pertinent questions. To restate: the goal is to gain insight into your technical as well as presentation capabilities.

Good Luck!
